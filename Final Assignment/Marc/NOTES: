* Misschien/waarschijnlijk nog post-contrast/post-hoc tests op de meeste plekken. (1,3,4)
* Betere uitleg, op het einde.
* Iets meer uitleg wat betreft de contrast waarschijnlijk. 

=>  Meer bij 1,2,3!!!!!!: For example, if there is a significant interaction, talk about why this might be. What does the interaction actually mean logically? 
* Overall wel all-effect plots?

#The final model's formula was log_RTs~Condition+Freqs+Knowledge+LP+Transparency+ Condition:LP + Freqs:LP  The overall effect of knowledge and condition were significant p<0.05. While LP was marginally significant.  The only interaction between predicors that was significant was Condtion:LP. However, it's worth noting that Freqs:LP was marginally significant. The model was significant overall (F(14,2051)=5.078, p<0.001) and explained small amount of variance (mult. R2=0.0240).  All regression coefficients, as well as their standard errors, t scores, and p-values, are provided in the appendix. Checking of model assumptions revealed no problems.

#In addition to the standard reporting of the results, please give a brief discussion of the findings. For example, if there is a significant interaction, talk about why this might be. What does the interaction actually mean logically? It's ok to speculate a bit here, since this is a statistics course and not a course about any one particular field.

#There was a significant interaction between Condition and LP. Which makes sense, since condition meant the figurative meaning or to the literal meaning of the last word, and LP is the literal plausibility of the idiom, which are both about how literal the idiom partly or in whole could be interpreted. So when the last word of the idiom can be interpreted quite literally, then the whole idiom also can be interpreted als more literal plausibal and thus the slope of LP changes as the value of condition changes. Apparantly also, the only signifcant predictors were knowledege and Condition wrt to reaction times. So, the more literal the meaning of the idiom's words could be interpreted and ofcourse how well the subject knows the idiom, are meaningful wrt to slower of faster reaction times.
